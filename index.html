I'm testing out different shits to see how shit works and how to make shit look good and shit.  Anyways, here it is.  The last website I did was just as dumb or even more dumb.  How about this global pandemic, btw?  Fucked up, right?.</p>

        <h3>I ♥️ Ketchup</h3>
        <p>I like-uh-the-ketchup for damn sure.  I put it on pretty much everything.  Burgers, fries, hot dogs (eff you no-ketchup-on-hot-dogs fascists! I likes it!!), corn dogs, eggs, bacon, sausage, fish, chicken sometimes, pizza (yeah, that's right I dip pizza in it too sometimes), fish sticks and white rice (on both the fish sticks AND rice), various frozen microwaveable crap like chicken nuggets and shit, and the list goes on and on and on and on and on and on.  If they forget to put ketchup in the bag with my order I lose my shit, but only for as long as it takes to walk to the fridge and grab my 32 oz. squeezer-  and you know I'm prepared with 3 or 4 back-ups in the cupboard too.  I ain't playing.  Lil' "tit-bit": I likes Heinz.  57.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="hot-sauce" src="images/hot-sauce.png" alt="hot-sauce-img">
        <h3>I ♥️ Hot Sauce</h3>
        <p>Mainly and especially Tapatio.  No home is complete without a bottle of Tapatio in the fridge next to the Heinz 57 (or Hunts, or Del Monte, or whatever the fuck you wannit).  I also put Tapatio on all of the above- even a little combo Ketch-Tap action going on sometimes.  We go through a quart of that shit every 3 or 4 weeks or so- I shit you not.  You'd think we were chugging the shit, which, admittedly I practically do.  In the debate between Tapatio and Cholula it's always been Tapatio 100, 24-7, 365, er' day, all night, all over it, Cholula can suck it, and you KNOW that shit is true.  Honorable mentions go out to El Yucateco red and green.  </p>
